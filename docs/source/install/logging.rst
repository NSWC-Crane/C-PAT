Logging 
########################################


C-PAT streams structured JSON logging objects to standard output (STDOUT). 
You should capture and persist these logging objects in accordance with your Organizational requirements. 


Logging schemas
---------------

The full JSON Schema of our logging objects is available here. This documentation is organized to describe each 
logging component separately and presents the relevant sub-schemas.

The ``data`` object is extensible and will contain structured details concerning the event. 

The contents of the logs can be controlled with the following :ref:`Environment Variables`: 

CPAT_LOG_LEVEL
    - Default: ``3``
    - Controls the granularity of the generated log output, from 1 to 4. Each level is inclusive of the ones before it. Level 1 will log only errors, level 2 includes warnings, level 3 includes status and transaction logs, and level 4 includes debug-level logs. 

CPAT_LOG_MODE
    - Default: ``combined``
    - Controls whether the API will create one "combined" log entry for http requests that includes both the request and response information; or two separate log entries, one for the request and one for the response, that can be correlated via a generated Request GUID in each entry.  Any value other than "combined" will produce separate log entries.
