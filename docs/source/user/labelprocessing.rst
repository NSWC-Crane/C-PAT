Label Processing
----------------

The Label Processing component contains the functionality to add labels within a collection. Labels can then be added to a POAM in step 9 of the POAM workflow. Labels are viewable in charts across C-PAT and serve as a quick and easy way to tag and identify POAMs that may have unique features or that may fall within the purview of a specific individual or group for action.

Labels can be added to a collection by selecting the "Add Label" button located beneath the labels table. This will open a modal window where the user can input a label name and description. Once the label is created, it will be added to the labels table and can be selected for use in the POAM workflow.

To modify a label, a user has two options.
   1. Clicking the row of the label in the table.
   2. Selecting the label from the dropdown menu located below the table.

Either option will open a pop-up form with the labels information. The user can modify the labels information and click "Save" to save the changes.
