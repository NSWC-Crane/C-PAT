POAM Creation
-------------

Manual POAM Entry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
While not recommended, POAMs can be created manually:

   1. All fields must be entered by the user
   2. Assets must be selected manually from the collection's asset list
   3. Requires more validation and verification

STIG Manager Integration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When creating a POAM from STIG Manager findings:

1. C-PAT automatically populates:

   * Description from STIG check
   * Vulnerability Source (set to "STIG")
   * STIG Title and Benchmark ID
   * Vulnerability ID 
   * Raw Severity / Adjusted Severity mapped from STIG finding
   * Scheduled completion date (calculated based on severity)

2. Asset Management:

   * The Assets tab displays a live feed of affected assets from STIG Manager
   * Assets are automatically updated based on the current state in STIG Manager
   * Assets cannot be manually added/removed as they are managed by STIG Manager

Tenable Integration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When creating a POAM from Tenable findings:

1. C-PAT automatically populates:

   * Description
   * Vulnerability Source (set to "ACAS")
   * Plugin ID
   * Raw Severity / Adjusted Severity (mapped from Tenable severity)
   * IAVM information (when applicable)
   * Scheduled completion date (calculated based on severity)

2. Asset Management:

   * The Assets tab shows real-time affected assets from Tenable
   * Asset list updates automatically based on current Tenable data
   * Assets cannot be manually modified as they reflect live Tenable data


Field Definitions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

POAM Status
   * Draft - Initial state
   * Submitted
   * Pending CAT-I Approval
   * Extension Requested
   * Approved
   * Rejected
   * Closed
   * False-Positive
   * Expired

Description
   * Control Vulnerability Description: Describes the vulnerability identified during assessment. This is pulled directly from the assessment procedure entry or technical assessment method (e.g., STIG test case) where applicable. Otherwise it must be manually entered in the NC status for the vulnerability.

Source Identifying Control Vulnerability
   * Identifies the source of the vulnerability (e.g., program review, test and evaluation program findings, IG DoD audit, and GAO audit).

Vulnerability ID
   * Security Checks - NIST -53Rev 4 Assessment Procedure, STIG / SRG Vulnerability ID, or ACAS Plugin ID (Do not leave this field blank).

Raw Severity
   * The initial or starting severity of the vulnerability prior to implementing mitigations and/or compensating Controls.

Adjusted Severity
   * Resulting Residual Risk after Proposed Mitigations: The risk level expected after any proposed mitigations are implemented. Proposed mitigations should be appropriately documented as POA&M milestones

Impact Description
   * Describe the identified impact.

Predisposing Conditions
   * A condition existing within an organization, a mission or business process, enterprise architecture, information system, or environment of operation, which affects (i.e., increases or decreases) the likelihood that threat events, once initiated, result in adverse impacts.

Scheduled Completion Date
   * Target completion date for resolving the vulnerability. This target completion date can stretch beyond the potential 3-year authorization window and must accurately reflect the resolution timetable. Please note that the initial date entered may not be changed. When a vulnerability severity value is resolved, the agency should note the actual completion date.

.. note::
   POAM Scheduled Completion Date is automated based on the severity of the vulnerability. CAT I - Critical and CAT I - High: 30 days, CAT II - Medium: 180 days, CAT III - Low and CAT III - Informational: 365 days.

Required Resources
   * Estimated funding or manpower resources required to resolve the security vulnerability (i.e., full-time equivalent).

Milestones
   * A milestone identifies specific requirements for correcting an identified vulnerability. The initial milestones and completion dates may not be altered. Any changes to the milestones should be noted in the Milestone Changes within the POAM extension panel.

Residual Risk
   * Residual Risk is automatically determined by the Adjusted Severity Value. If the Adjusted Severity Value is not present, the Residual Risk is determined by the Raw Severity.

.. note::
   Residual Risk is calculated based on the Adjusted Severity Value. If the Adjusted Severity Value is not present, the Residual Risk is determined by the Raw Severity.

Likelihood
   * Likelihood is automatically determined by the Adjusted Severity Value. If the Adjusted Severity Value is not present, the Likelihood is determined by the Raw Severity.

.. note::
   Likelihood is calculated based on the Adjusted Severity Value. If the Adjusted Severity Value is not present, the Likelihood is determined by the Raw Severity.

Mitigations
   * Any currently implemented mitigations and/or compensating Controls that will reduce the risk. A planned mitigation or compensating Control cannot lower risk until implemented.
